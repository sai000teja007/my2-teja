# Sai Teja Thatikonda
Welcome! My name is Sai Teja Thatikonda. I make puns that will make people laugh since I am the human equivalent of a multi-tool. During the day, I work as a spreadsheet whiz, crunching numbers with the precision of an over-caffeinated squirrel. But at night, I transform into a stand-up comic whose barrage of dad jokes can make even the most serious statues laugh. When I once tried to be serious, the universe just laughed at me. So here I am, ready to make your day brighter by channeling my inner goofball.
